# Sleeping-Habits-of-Couples
(Dataset by fivethirtyeight)
I analyzed the sleeping habits of couples. In the dataset I used in my analysis, respondents answer questions like 'how often do you sleep in separate beds?' and 'What are the reasons that you sleep in separate beds?'
Some other variables, such as age, income and region is included in the dataset

### Main insights:

1) 40% of the respondents sleep in separate beds either every night (14%), once a year or less(12%), once a month or less(9%), a few times per month(4%)

2) Couples who have been married for short amount of time tend to sleep together compare to couples who have been married for a longer time

3) Household income is not a significant determinant of sleeping together or separate

4) Couples who have high-school degree tend to sleep together compare to couples who have bachelor degree

5) Among the regions, the lowest percentage of sleeping together belongs to West North Central with 43%

6) Couples who are between 30-44 years old tends to sleep in separate beds compare to couples who are 18-29 years old
